NAME
    Filesys::DiskFree -- perform the Unix command 'df' in a portable fashion

SYNOPSIS
        use Filesys::DiskFree;

        $handle = new Filesys::DiskFree;
        $handle->df();
        print "The root device is ".$handle->device("/")."\n";
        print "It has ".$handle->avail("/")." bytes available\n";
        print "It has ".$handle->total("/")." bytes total\n";
        print "It has ".$handle->used("/")." bytes used\n";

DESCRIPTION
    Filesys::DiskFree does about what the unix command df(1) does, listing
    the mounted disks, and the amount of free space used & available.

  Functions

    Filesys::DiskFree->set('option' => 'value')
        Sets various options within the module.

        The most common option to change is the mode, which can be either
        blocks or inodes. By default, blocks is used.

        If reading a file from a 'foreign' OS using the load() function,
        format may be used, which takes the name of an OS as set in the $^O
        variable.

        Returns the previous values of the options.

    Filesys::DiskFree->df()
        Perfoms a 'df' command, and stores the values for later use.

    Filesys::DiskFree->command()
        Returns the appropriate command to do a 'df' command, for the
        current format. This is used when you wish to call a df on a remote
        system. Use the df() method for local df's.

        Returns undef if there isn't an appropriate command.

    Filesys::DiskFree->load($line)
        Reads in the output of a 'df', $line can be either a scalar or a
        filehandle. If $line is a filehandle, then the filehandle is read
        until EOF.

        Returns undef on failure

    Filesys::DiskFree->disks()
        Returns all the disks known about

    Filesys::DiskFree->device($id)
        Returns the device for $id, which is a scalar containing the device
        name of a disk or a filename, in which case the disk that filename
        in stored upon is used.

    Filesys::DiskFree->mount($id)
        Returns the mount point for $id, which is a scalar containing the
        device name of a disk or a filename, in which case the disk that
        filename in stored upon is used.

    Filesys::DiskFree->avail($id)
        Returns the amount of available space in bytes for $id, which is a
        scalar containing the device name of a disk or a filename, in which
        case the disk that filename in stored upon is used.

    Filesys::DiskFree->total($id)
        Returns the amount of total space in bytes for $id, which is a
        scalar containing the device name of a disk or a filename, in which
        case the disk that filename in stored upon is used.

    Filesys::DiskFree->used($id)
        Returns the amount of used space in bytes for $id, which is a scalar
        containing the device name of a disk or a filename, in which case
        the disk that filename in stored upon is used.

BUGS
        It should support more formats, currently only Linux, Irix, Solaris
        & BSD are supported. Other formats will be added as available.
        Please sent your OS Name & version, the 'best' df options to use,
        and the output of df with those options, and the contents of $^O if
        you have access to a non-supported format.
